			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Context</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Powering the future of marketing campaigns</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">Shopify Marketing helps merchants take their small online businesses to the next level. The marketing section allows anyone with a Shopify store to market their products on a variety of social channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, etc. These third-parties build easy-to-use marketing campaigns composed of components Shopify controls and designs. So, rather than going through the long arduous process of figuring out how to market on those different channels, merchants can simply fill these third-party created forms in their admin.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Role</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Designing around techical constraints</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">This was a highly-technical 8-week project where I gained a deep understanding of the UX and tech behind Shopify. As the sole designer on the team, I worked closely with the front-end and back-end developers to understand all the technical requirements and constraints and collaborated with the product manager to gather the needs of the third-party developers. I saw this product through multiple iterations and shipped it to production.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Expanding Shopify's marketing offering</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">Previously, marketing campaigns revolved solely around a merhcant's products, such as product ads on Facebook and Google. As Shopify's marketing offering was growing, third parties like Snapchat were requesting for more complex components that could help power new marketing campaigns. Many third-parties were asking for the implementation of an image picker component, which would open up a world of new types of campaigns. The image picker would give merchants access to any image they've every uploaded on their admin (product images, slideshow images, blog assets, etc.) and use it in marketing campaigns, allowing merchants go beyond advertising products and build a brand. 
				<br>
				<br>So, how do we give merchants the ability to leverage stand-alone images in their marketing campaigns?</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Objective</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Creating new revenue streams for us and our merchants</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">We, as a team, decided that the goal of the component was to generate rapid adoption by third-party app developers creating marketing campaigns using this image picker component and in turn, wide-spread use of brand-building marketing campaigns, leveraging the image picker, by merchants. By following this guiding objective during my design process, I always knew why I was designing, to make marketing better for everyone.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Research</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Scoping out features and user flows</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">This project required a combined effort from the product, user research and dev team. Through surveys, we researched the merchant's and developer's needs for this component. Then, together in a white-boarding session, we planned out all the features and states of the component that would meet the needs of merchants and developers.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">User journey</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Walking down the desirable and undesirable paths</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px"> The whiteboarding session set a strong foundation for me to be able to map out all the possible paths a merchant might take in trying to interact with the image picker. Researching the journey of the merchant in the first stages of this project helped a lot in understanding all the different states of the image picker that I needed to account for.

				<center><figcaption>There were a LOT of cases to consider</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Uploading images</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Simplifying the user journey</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">A huge feature of the image picker was the ability to upload images through this component directly into your admin. Why? One key scenario was the merchant being dissatisfied with the image assets they currently had and wanting to upload some new images for their campagin. So, instead of going thorugh the hassle of going into the Files section of the admin and then trying to upload an image there. The image picker would allow them to upload directly inside the component and use it at the same time. Thus, saving our merchants a tremendous amount of time and ultimately, money. There were many possible paths to go about this and I explored a few flows that a merchant could go through in order to upload images.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Accessibility</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Making marketing accessible for everyone</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">A wise person once said, with great power comes great responsibility. The web is a tool of enormous power, it is up to us, the people, to decide whether the power is used for good, such as enabling people to own their own businesses, or for evil, such as a government censoring its citizens. Thus, it is our responsibility to make the web accessible for anyone and everyone. Shopify put a big emphasis on accessibility and making our platform accessible. In doing so, we built a large team of accessiblity experts that are always available for critiques and feedback sessions. So, in keeping up with the mission of making the web more accessible, I set up a various meetings with our accessibility experts and together, we made sure my image picker met the <a class="link2" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Guidelines</a>.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Mobile web</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Considering all screen sizes</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">After some final feedback and refinement, I came up with this final design and mocked it up in Origami Studio.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Outcome</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Learnings from my first real product design work</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">The mobile native marketing section redesign is now in the build phase. Furthermore, since no team within Shopify had touched the mobile design system in a while, I even got to submit the redesign to the design system committee. And so, I was also able to introduce some new patterns within native mobile Polaris. Being my first real product design internship, I learned so much in these 16 weeks. Some key insights I got were:
			<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>As cliche as it sounds, feedback truly is a gift. By seeking out those more experienced than me, I was able to constantly refine and incorporate the knowledge of more senior designers into my work.</li>
					<li>Looping in stakeholders, specifically with the dev side, is extremely important. By talking to my mobile devs early on, I gained a fundamental understanding of the technical constraints of the mobile space before I started designing. This helped me to flesh out ideas that were actually possible for the devs to implement.</li>
