			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Role</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Designing around techical constraints</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">This was a highly-technical 8-week project where I gained a deep understanding of the UX and tech powering Shopify. As the sole product designer on the team, I worked closely with the front-end and back-end developers to understand all the technical requirements and constraints and collaborated with the product manager to gather the needs of the third-party developers. I saw this product through multiple iterations and shipped the first version to production.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Designing with a purpose</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">Previously, marketing campaigns revolved solely around a merchant's products, such as product ads on Facebook or on Google Shopping. However, as Shopify's marketing category was growing, third-party developers were requesting for merchants to have the ability to leverage stand-alone images in marketing campaigns. In particular, Snapchat wanted to release a marketing channel for merchants to upload a custom snap icon and advertise their stores. The team understood that allowing for stand-alone images in marketing would open up a world of new types of campaigns; it would give merchants access to go beyond advertising products and build a brand. Thus, we decided this would be a worthy challenge to tackle for our merchants.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">
				<img src="why.jpg" alt="How do we give our merchants the ability to leverage stand-alone images in their marketing campaigns?" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>Always keep in mind "Why?" you are designing a product</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Objective</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Creating new revenue streams for us and our merchants</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">We, as a team, decided that the best tool to allow merchants to leverage stand-alone images would be an image picker component, powered by Shopify's powerful Files API. The picker would allow merchants to access any image they've ever uploaded to their admin as well as the added functionality of being able to upload new images.

				<br>
				<br>
			 The goal of the component was to have rapid adoption by third-party app developers and in turn, wide-spread use of the image picker to power brand-building marketing campaigns. Keeping in mind these objectives, I always knew why I was designing: to make marketing better for everyone.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Research</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Scoping out features and requirements</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">This project required a combined effort from the product, user research and dev team. Through surveys, we researched the merchant's and developer's needs for this component. Then, together in a white-boarding session, we planned out all the features and release versions of the component that would meet the needs of merchants and developers.</p>

				<center><figcaption>The fruits of our team's whiteboarding session</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">User flow</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Walking down the desirable and undesirable paths</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px"> The whiteboarding session set a strong foundation for me to be able to map out all the possible paths a merchant might take in trying to interact with the image picker. Researching the journey of the merchant in the first stages of this project helped a lot in understanding all the different states of the image picker that I needed to account for.

				<img src="" alt="user flows" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>There were a LOT of cases to consider</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Uploading images</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Simplifying processes</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">A huge feature of the image picker was the ability to upload images through this component directly into your admin. Why? One key scenario was the merchant being dissatisfied with the image assets they currently had and wanting to upload some new images for their campagin. So, instead of going thorugh the hassle of going into the Files section of the admin and then trying to upload an image there. The image picker would allow them to upload directly inside the component and use it at the same time. Thus, saving our merchants a tremendous amount of time and ultimately, money.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Accessibility</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Making marketing accessible for everyone</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">A wise person once said, with great power comes great responsibility. The web is a tool of enormous power, it is up to us, the people, to decide whether the power is used for good, such as enabling people to own their own businesses, or for evil, such as a government censoring its citizens. Thus, it is our responsibility to make the web accessible for anyone and everyone. Shopify put a big emphasis on accessibility and making our platform accessible. In doing so, we built a large team of accessiblity experts that are always available for critiques and feedback sessions. So, in keeping up with the mission of making the web more accessible, I set up a various meetings with our accessibility experts and together, we made sure my image picker met the <a class="link2" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Guidelines</a>.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Mobile web</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Considering all screen sizes</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">While translating my original wide screen designs to mobile width, I quickly learned some of my initial patterns didn't work on small screen. So I had to rethink some of the patterns to ensure they were a good experience on both wide and small screens.
			</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 18px">The improved design leveraged mobile user's tendency to scroll

			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Testing</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Breaking my design and re-building</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">After some final feedback and refinement, I worked with my dev team to ship my component for a testing session. I learned that there are so many variables in shipping new products and it is impossible to consider them all beforehand. Testing was the only way to capture more states and then design solutions around them.
			</p>

				<img src="versions.jpg" alt="the nine iterations of my design" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>Going through 9 rounds of feedback and iterations was brutal but ultimately worth it</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Final product</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Looking back at all the work that went into this project</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">After some final feedback and refinement, I refined my design and helped to ship V1 of the image picker.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Outcome</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Learnings from shipping my first product</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">I got to see my image picker shipped before the end of my internship. It has powered the marketing campaigns of over 40,000+ merchants world-wide. My first foray into design taught me a lot about myself as a designer and set up strong foundations for my design process. Some key lessons were:
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Right from the start of the project, clearly understand why you are designing something.</li>
					<li>Collaboration with all disciplines is extremely important in helping a designer to understand their problem space.</li>
					<li>Iterate, iterate, and iterate; your design is never "done" by testing the limits of your design, you can always discover something to be improved upon.</li>
				</ul>
