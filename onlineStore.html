					Context

			</div>
			<div class="text-work-right">
				<p>
					In the Fall of 2019, I worked on the Online Store team at Shopify HQ in Ottawa, Canada. Our team was responsible for providing our merchants everything they need to start an online store and sell online in minutes. Specifically, we oversaw a <a style= "color: #70B8DF" class="link2" href="https://www.shopify.ca/online" target="_blank">website builder tool</a>—called the Theme Editor—that empowered entrepreneurs to seamlessly design and update the look and feel of their online storefront.

				<h3>
					Problem
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text-work-right">
				<p>
					Originally released in 2010, Shopify’s Theme Editor was a cutting-edge product at the time. It provided the option for you to custom code a store site and for those that were less technically adept, Shopify provided a no-code option in the form of template designs (themes) that merchants could then modify to easily get an online store up and running with 0 code required.
					<br>
					<br>
					However in 2019, merchants felt that our Theme Editor’s no-code paradigm of modifying a pre-designed template was restrictive and unoriginal. We did not have modern drag and drop design capabilities, draft changes or content portability when a merchant wanted to change a theme. (Plus a whole host of other issues that came along with the outdated system architecture)
					<br>
					<br>
					On the other hand, the <a style= "color: #70B8DF" class="link2" href="https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d" target="_blank">no-code movement</a> had made leaps and bounds. Companies like <a style= "color: #70B8DF" class="link2" href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> had drag and drop site builders that were only limited by the imaginations of their users.

					<h3>
						Goal
					</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="text-work-right">
					<p>
						Specifically, what I worked on was imagining how our diverse app ecosystem would integrate in this new paradigm of full customization on every page with themes only being a cosmetic layer and not dictating the information architecture of the page.
						<br>
						<br>
						Thus, I wanted to make app integration a seamless no-code experience in the new online store too. To measure success in this project, I partnered with our data team to look at conversion rate from the old paradigm to the new online store editor, the number of support calls regarding app installation, configuration and deletion and lastly the install rate of apps in this site builder.

				<h3>
					Feature <br>Parity
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text-work-right">
				<p>
					In the old theme editor, our 3rd party partners had free reign with our Online Store API. Shopify’s ethos was to empower app partners to use our APIs to create any features and tools we were unable to provide our merchants. However, as we scaled, this free reign had gotten a bit out of control. App partners no longer abided by our design system that we provided them and the overall user experience of utilizing apps became fragmented.

				<h3>
					Install <br>Friction
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text-work-right">
				<p>
					Furthermore, since the old Online Store API did not allow for custom drag and drop configurations on every web page, installing 3rd party apps was cumbersome for merchants. Apps that connected with one’s online store required merchants to go into their online store’s code and manually paste in a code snippet the developer provided. This approach was inaccessible at best and untrustworthy at worst.

				<h3>
					Solution
				</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="text-work-right">
				<p>
					Clearly, it was time to update the Theme Editor in order to address the pain points of our merchants and regain dominance in the store site builder product market. Thus, one of our top priorities for 2020 was to ship a ground-up rebuild of the store site builder tool; it would feature modern capabilities—such as a full drag and drop interface, a drafts workspace and content portability between themes—to compete with our competitors.
					<br>
					<br>
					I <b>led user research and design</b> on a core feature that helped merchants seamlessly integrate third-party storefront design apps—think product review apps and promotional pop-up apps—onto their storefronts with no code required. This project provided me an amazing learning opportunity to <b>leverage user research to make informed product decisions, information architecture to establish mental models and intuitive design tooling to simplify workflows.</b>
