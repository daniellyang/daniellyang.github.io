			<h3 style="margin-top: 80px">Context</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Make marketing better for everyone</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">Shopify Marketing helps merchants take their small online businesses to the next level. The marketing section allows anyone with a Shopify store to market their products on a variety of social channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, etc. Merchants simply fill out forms within their store admin, comprised of components Shopify controls and designs, rather than going through the long arduous process of figuring out how to market on those different channels.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ultimately, the team's mission is to reduce the barrier to entry to online marketing for business owners, making marketing accessible for everyone.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Role</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">A designer's best work comes through collaboration with all disciplines</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">This was a 16-week project where I was the sole product designer, working closely on a team with a product manager, a data scientist, and an Android develper and an iOS developer. The tools I used were Sketch and Origami Studio.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Building upon a minimum <strike>viable</strike> product</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">Since the marketing section was a relatively <a class="link2" href="https://www.shopify.ca/blog/marketing-in-shopify" target="_blank">new product feature</a>, the team had only shipped a minimum viable product, as such, the marketing section within the mobile app was only a web-view inside a container.
			<br>
			<br>
			Sure, it was a viable product, but we could do better; the design lacked consistency with the rest of the mobile app and did not leverage the strengths of the mobile platform. Thus, the marketing section within the mobile app experience was clunky, buggy and not useful for merchants.</p>

				<center><figcaption>Marketing section web view(left) and marketing section within the mobile native app(right), they were the same</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Goals</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Make mobile marketing better for everyone</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">After scoping out the problem, our goals to use as our "north star" to guide our design process were: 
				<ul>
					<li>Revamp the marketing section to a fully native mobile experience that adhered to Shopify's <a class="link2" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> design system</li>
					<li>Create an experience that is friendly to both first time and repeat users of the marketing section</li>
					<li>Design something scaleable and robust enough for the addition of future components and more complex marketing campaigns</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Initial exploration</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Building a scaleable design</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">From our audits, we found the current design to be not scaleable; the form had no central organizational system  and new components were just appeneded on. So, as marketing campaigns got more complex, with more features, forms would got longer and more unorganized. To tackle this scalability issue, I drew up a new IA that established an organized structure to the components and grouped them based on the component's purpose.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">
				<img src="ia change.jpg" alt="information architecture change" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>New form IA that organized information in a clear structure and gave the merchant feedback on the purpose of each component</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<p> Furthermore, we found that the forms would get too unwieldy as more resources(products,tags etc.) were added to the page. Thus, I came up with a new user flow that was goal-driven, in a way game-ifying the campaign creation experience and giving the illusion that the form is shorter than it actually is. To do this, the new flow would leverage the strengths of the mobile medium, such as drill down menus and tap-ins. Each page gave the merchant a clear purpose/goal and this new flow would cut down on the length of the main form page. The inspiration for this flow was drawn from the Products and Discounts section inside the app, both of which were fleshed out flows that were tested and proven.</p>

				<center><figcaption>My proposal for a more goal-driven and organized user flow</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<p>Now that I had a consistent user flow, I came up with some initial mockups of the process a merchant might go through in a resource picker component. To maintain the consistency of experience throughout the app, I did a deep dive into <a class="link2" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> and other parts of the app to translate the web designs into native mobile designs.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Revisions</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Prototyping and testing for the real world</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">I quickly discovered the trap that many designers fall into of never actualy stress-testing your designs in a real world scenario. Furthermore, I've always valued the importance of getting feedback early. So after doing some rapid-prototyping, I got my design in the hands of other designers to get their critiques and some valuable feedback:
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Though it was a more organized and scalable flow, with so many drill down menus, the form became too slow to go through</li>
					<li>Since pages were 4 levels deep sometimes, it was difficult for merchants to keep track of their progress(ie. how many products they added to their campaign)</li>
					<li>With all the prompts and screens, it was a great experience for first-time merchants, but power-users wouldn't be able to quickly create campaigns</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> A lot of the feedback centered around the proposed new flow, people liked the scalability of it, but the time it took for a merchant to get through the process also needed to be shortened. The testing and critique sessions were an invaluable lesson in learning about trade-offs and designing for as many types of users as possible.</p>

				<center><figcaption>Revised flow to maintain scalability but simplify the process to create campaign</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Now with the revised user flow and keeping in mind the feedback that I had gotten from the experienced designers around me, I once again mocked up what the experience would be like for a merchant.

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Prototype</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px"> 
			Here is the final prototype and design for the marketing section mobile native redesign.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Reflections</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">The mobile native marketing section redesign is now in the build phase. Since no team within Shopify had touched the mobile design system in a while, our team submitted the redesign to the design system committee to introduce as new patterns within native mobile Polaris.</p>
