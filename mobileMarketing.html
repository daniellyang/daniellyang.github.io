			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Context</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">A designer's best work comes through collaboration</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">During my time at Shopify I worked under the Marketing Technology team, handling the marketing section. Launching in late 2018, our team's mission was to help merchants take their small businesses to the next level, by empowering them to market on a variety of social channels, such as Facebook and Google, all within the Shopify admin (under the marketing section).
				<br>
				<br>
				This was a 12 week project that I championed as the sole product designer. I worked closely with a product manager, a data scientist, and an Android develper and an iOS developer. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The tools I used were Sketch, for UI/UX design, and Origami Studio, for prototyping.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem space</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Transforming a web view into a native mobile design</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px"> Since the marketing section was a relatively new product feature, marketing forms within the mobile app were web-views within a container. Thus, the design lacked consistency with the rest of the native mobile experience and did not leverage the strengths of the mobile platform, culminating in a clunky, buggy and not merchant-friendly experience.</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Business opportunity</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Emerging markets outside of North America are mobile-first</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">The future of Shopify's business is in emerging markets, where smartphones are much more accessible than desktops. In fact, one of Shopify's key markets is China, where mobile usage dominates the market; thus, it was crucial to deliver a great mobile user experience for these target markets.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Market research</h3>
		<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Drawing inspiration from Airbnb's frictionless form pages</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 18px">I began by researching form page designs and landed on Airbnb's host set up form. I was in awe of how the team there was able to create such a frictionless and goal-oriented experience for something users normally dread and find mundane.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="biggerWidth">
		<figure style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 35px">
			<img src="airbnb.png" alt="demonstration of how long forms could get" style='width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
			<center><figcaption>Airbnb displaying their mastery over making long form pages delightful experiences to fill out</figcaption></center>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<div class="normalWidth">
		<p> Some key takeaways from researching Airbnb's form page designs:
			<ul>
				<li>Decoupled forms establish a journey for the user to embark upon and make the process less mundane</li>
				<li>A clear goal on each form page keeps the user focused and gameifys the experience</li>
				<li>The progress bar reminds the user of the effort they've put in and gets them to push through</li>
			</ul></p>
			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Visual design</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Adhering to Polaris and Material Design Guidelines</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">The previous web view created an inconsistent experience with the rest of the native experience inside the mobile app. Thus, I had to first modernize the visual design language within Facebook carousel ad creation. Below, is an example of the visual design changes that were implemented in the ad scheduling component.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="biggerWidth">
			<figure style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 15px">
				<img src="old web.jpg" alt="what was wrong with the old visual design" style='width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>				</figure>
			</div>

			<div class="biggerWidth">
				<figure style="margin-top: 15px;margin-bottom: 60px">
					<img src="new view.png" alt="new design that adhered to Polaris and Material Design" style='width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				</figure>
			</div>

			<div class="normalWidth">
				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Information architecture</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Designing a scaleable marketing section</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px">The form had no organizational structure and new components were simply appended onto the end. I took into account the constraints of all the campaign types in the marketing section to establish an organized structure to form components and group them based on the component's purpose.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="biggerWidth">
				<figure style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">
					<img src="ia.png" alt="information architecture change" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
					<center><figcaption>New form IA that organized information in a clear structure and gave the merchant feedback on the purpose of each component</figcaption></center>
				</figure>
			</div>

			<div class="normalWidth">
				<p>However, forms would get too unwieldy as more resources were added to the page. This was a non-issue on desktop because of the excess screen real-estate, but mobile couldn't afford to be wasteful. Thus, I came up with a new user flow that gameified the creation experience. To do this, it would leverage the strengths of the mobile medium, such as drill-downs and tap-ins.</p>

				<!--<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Preview</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Giving the merchant power to see their progress</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 18px">One of the main features of Facebook carousel ads was the dynamic preview. Merchants could see their progress affecting the way their ad would look live. However, mobile web essentially killed the functionality of this feature because it got moved all the way to the bottom of the form.</p>

				<figure class="caseImages">
					<img src="preview.jpg" alt="preview bar fix" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Feedback</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Receiving feedback early and iterating upon ideas</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px">I fell into the trap of never actually stress-testing your designs in a real world scenario. So, I whipped up a rapid prototype to get critiques and valuable feedback:
					<ul>
						<li>Though it was a more organized and scalable flow, with so many drill down menus, the form became too slow to go through</li>
						<li>Since pages were 4 levels deep sometimes, it was difficult for merchants to keep track of their progress(ie. how many products they added to their campaign)</li>
						<li>With all the prompts and screens, it was a great experience for first-time merchants, but power-users wouldn't be able to quickly create campaigns</li>
					</ul>

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Prototype</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Creating an interactive product</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 18px">After some final feedback and refinement, I came up with this final design and mocked it up in Origami Studio.

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Impact</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Revitalizing Shopify's mobile design</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px">The mobile native marketing section redesign is now in the build phase. Since no team within Shopify had touched the mobile design system in a while, I was able to introduce some new patterns to our mobile design system.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Reflections</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Learnings from these 12 weeks</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px">
					<ul>
						<li>As cliché as it sounds, feedback truly is a gift. By seeking out those more experienced than me, I was able to refine and incorporate the knowledge of more senior designers into my work.</li>
						<li>Looping in stakeholders is extremely important. By talking to my developers early on, I gained a fundamental understanding of the technical constraints of the mobile space.</li>
						<li>Most importantly, this internship taught me to never forget about our merchants, the people whose livelihoods depend on us</li>
