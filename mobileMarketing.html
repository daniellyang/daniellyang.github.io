			<h2 style="margin-top: 80px">Role</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">This was a 12 week project where I was the sole product designer on a team with a product manager, user researcher, data scientist and an android develper and an iOS developer. I worked with <b>Sketch</b>, for wireframes and UI design, and <b>Origami Studio</b>, for interactive prototypes.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Context</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">Shopify Marketing helps small business-owners take their online stores to the next level. The marketing section allows anyone with a Shopify store to market their products on a variety of social channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, etc. Merchants <b>simply fill out forms within their store admin</b>, comprised of components Shopify controls and designs, rather than going through the long arduous process of figuring out how to market on those different channels.
				<br>
				<br>
				Ultimately, the team's mission is to <b>reduce the barrier to entry</b> to online marketing for business owners, <b>making marketing accessible for everyone</b>.
			</p>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">The marketing section was a relatively new product and <b>the mobile native design was a minimum viable product(MVP)</b>. So, the marketing section inside the mobile app was only a web-view; the design lacked consistency with the rest of the mobile app(that had a native design) and did not leverage the strengths of mobile. Thus, the marketing section within <b>the mobile app experience was clunky, buggy and not useful for merchants.</b></p>

			<figure class="caseImages">
				<img src="mobile web view.jpg" alt="old mobile web view" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<figcaption>As you can see on the right, the marketing section inside the mobile native app was just a web-view(on the left) inside a container</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Goals</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">A lot of planning went into this project beforehand since it was such a major overhaul. Together, the team decided on some key metrics that we would use as our "north star" to guide the design process: 
				<ul>
					<li>Revamp the marketing section to a fully native mobile experience that adhered to Shopify's <a class="link2" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> design system</li>
					<li>Design an experience that is friendly to both first time and repeat users of the marketing section</li>
					<li>Create a scalable design robust enough for the addition of future components and more complex marketing campaigns</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Initial exploration</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">Since the current MVP was just not scalable, I first addressed the issue of scalability. The current design allowed only for unordered components and new components were just appeneded on. So, as marketing campaigns got more complex, with more features, forms would got longer and more unorganized. To tackle this scalability issue, I proposed a new user flow that leveraged the strengths of the mobile medium, such as drill down menus and tap-ins. The inspiration for this new user flow was drawn from the Products and Discounts section inside the app, both of which were fleshed out flows that were tested and proven.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">

				<figcaption>My proposal for a scalable and consistent user flow</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Now that I had a consistent user flow, I came up with some initial mockups of the process a merchant might go through in a resource picker component. To maintain the consistency of experience throughout the app, I did a deep dive into <a class="link2" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> and other parts of the app to translate the web designs into native mobile designs.</p>

			</figure>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Revisions</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">I've always valued the importance of getting feedback early, so after my initial explorations, there was a general consensus that sorting the components was a good idea but having it be it's own screen was overkill.
				<br>
				<br>
				Furthermore, some more feedback that I got with the initial exploration were: 
				<ul>
					<li>Though it was a more organized and scalable flow, with so many drill down menus, it was simply too slow to create a campaign</li>
					<li>Since pages were 4 levels deep sometimes, it was difficult for merchants to keep track of their progress(ie. how many products they added to their campaign)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				<figcaption>Revised flow to maintain scalability but simplify the process to create campaign</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Now with the revised user flow and keeping in mind the feedback that I had gotten from the experienced designers around me, I once again mocked up what the experience would be like for a merchant.

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Prototype</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px"> 
			Here is the final prototype and design for the marketing section mobile native redesign.</p>

			<h2 style="margin-top: 60px">Reflections</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">The mobile native marketing section redesign is now in the build phase. Since no team within Shopify had touched the mobile design system in a while, our team submitted the redesign to the design system committee to introduce as new patterns within native mobile Polaris.</p>
