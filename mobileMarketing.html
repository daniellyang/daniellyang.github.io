			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Context</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">A designer's best work comes through collaboration</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">During my time at Shopify I worked under the Marketing Technology team, handling the marketing section. Launching in late 2018, our team's mission was to empower our merchants to be able to market on a variety of social channels, such as Facebook and Google, all within the Shopify admin, in turn, helping them take their small businesses to the next level.
				<br>
				<br>
				This was a 12 week project that I championed as the lead product designer. I worked closely with a product manager, a data scientist, and an Android develper and an iOS developer.

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem space</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Transforming a web view into a mobile native design</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px"> Since the marketing section was a new product feature, the first iteration within the mobile app was only an MVP. The marketing campaign creation forms were simply web-views shrunk down. Thus, the design lacked consistency with the rest of the native mobile experience and did not leverage the strengths of the mobile platform. All this culminated in a clunky and merchant-hostile experience.</p>

			<p style="margin-top: 18px">The future of Shopify's business is in emerging markets, where smartphones are much more accessible than desktops. In fact, one of Shopify's key markets for expansion is Asia, where mobile usage dominates the market; thus, it was crucial to deliver a great mobile user experience for these target markets.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Research</h3>
		<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Drawing inspiration from Airbnb's frictionless form pages</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 18px">I began by researching form page designs and landed on Airbnb's host set up form. I was in awe of how the team there was able to create such a frictionless and goal-oriented experience for something users normally dread and find mundane.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="biggerWidth">
		<figure style="margin-top: 30px;margin-bottom: 35px">
			<img src="airbnb.png" alt="demonstration of how long forms could get" style='width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
			<center><figcaption>Airbnb displaying their mastery over making long form pages delightful experiences to fill out</figcaption></center>
		</figure>
	</div>
	<div class="normalWidth">
		<p> Some key takeaways from researching Airbnb's form page designs:
			<ul>
				<li>Decoupled form pages helped to establish a journey for the user to embark upon, making the purpose of each form page clear</li>
				<li>An immediate and clear goal on each form page keeps the user focused and creates the experience of a quest rather than a chore</li>
				<li>The progress bar on the header informs the user of the effort they've put in and how close they are to the finish line</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Information architecture</h3>
		<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Designing a scaleable and goal-driven long form similar to Airbnb's</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 20px">The original Facebook carousel ad form had no organizational structure and components were simply appended onto the end with no thought or reason. Thus, the first step was to take into account the constraints of all campaign types in the marketing section and the research I did on Airbnb to establish an organized structure to form components and group them based on the component's purpose.</p>

		<figure style="margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px">
			<img src="ia.png" alt="information architecture change" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
			<center><figcaption>New form IA that organized information in a clear structure and gave the merchant feedback on the purpose of each component</figcaption></center>
		</figure> 

		<p>However, forms would get too unwieldy as more resources were added to the page. This was a non-issue on desktop because of the excess screen real-estate, but mobile couldn't afford to be wasteful. Thus, I came up with a new user flow that was inspired by Airbnb's goal oriented flow. To do this, it would leverage the strengths of the mobile medium, such as drill-downs and tap-ins.</p>

		<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Visual design</h3>
		<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Adhering to Polaris and Material Design Guidelines</h2>
		<p style="margin-top: 18px">The previous web view created an inconsistent experience with the rest of the native experience inside the mobile app. Thus, I had to first modernize the visual design language within Facebook carousel ad creation. Below, is an example of the visual design changes that were implemented in the ad scheduling component.</p>

		<div class="normalWidth">
				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Accessible preview</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Giving the merchant power to see their progress</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 18px">Merchant's favourite feature of Facebook carousel ad creation was the accessible dynamic preview. They could see their progress and how editing each form element would affect the way their ad would look live on Facebook. However, mobile web essentially killed the functionality of this feature due to it being pushed to the bottom of the form. So, one of the main features of this redesign was moving preview into a sticky footer button; merchants could once again keep track of their ad creation progress on mobile.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Feedback</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Receiving feedback early and iterating upon ideas</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 18px">I learned early on how important it is to get feedback early from those with more experience. Not only did I book meetings with senior designers for their perspectives, I also reached out to developers early on. Therefore, I was able to solve issues for both UX and eng early on. This project was a huge lesson in understanding the importance of feedback for my own design process.

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Impact</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Revitalizing Shopify's mobile design</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px">The mobile native marketing section redesign is now in the build phase. Since no team within Shopify had touched the mobile design system in a while, I was able to introduce some new patterns to our mobile design system.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Reflections</h3>
				<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Learnings from these 12 weeks</h2>
				<p style="margin-top: 20px">
					<ul>
						<li>As cliché as it sounds, feedback truly is a gift. By seeking out those more experienced than me, I was able to refine and incorporate the knowledge of more senior designers into my work.</li>
						<li>Looping in stakeholders is extremely important. By talking to my developers early on, I gained a fundamental understanding of the technical constraints of the mobile space.</li>
						<li>Most importantly, this internship taught me to never forget about our merchants, the people whose livelihoods depend on us, and to always have a purpose when I design</li>
