			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Role</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">A designer's best work comes through collaboration</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">This was a 16-week project where I was the sole product designer, working closely on a team with a product manager, a data scientist, and an Android develper and an iOS developer. The tools I used were Sketch, for UI design, and <a class="link2" href="https://origami.design/" target="_blank">Origami Studio</a>, for prototyping.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Context</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Making marketing better for everyone</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">In October 2018, Shopify launched the marketing section. Our team was created to help merchants take their small businesses to the next level; it allows anyone with a Shopify store to market their products on a variety of social channels such as Facebook, Instagram, Google Shopping, etc. 
				<br>
				<br>
			Ultimately, our team mission was to reduce the barrier to entry to online marketing for business owners, making online marketing more accessible.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">
				<img src="marketing.jpg" alt="marketing picture" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>Just some of the platforms merchants could market on</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Problem</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Building upon a minimum <strike>viable</strike> product</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">Since the marketing section was a relatively new product feature, the team had only shipped a minimum viable product at launch. As such, marketing forms such as Facebook carousel ads within the mobile app was only a web-view.
				<br>
				<br>
			Sure, it was a viable product, but we could do better; the design lacked consistency with the rest of the native experience within the mobile app and did not leverage the strengths of the mobile platform. This culminated in the experience being clunky, buggy and not merchant-friendly.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">
				<img src="mobile web view.jpg" alt="old mobile web view" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>Facebook carousel ads web view(left) and Facebook carousel ads within the mobile native app(right), they were the same</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<p>Furthermore, the future of Shopify's business is in emerging markets, where smartphones are much more accessible than desktops; it was crucial to deliver a great mobile user experience for these key potential markets. Therefore, my role was to modernize Facebook carousel ads into a mobile native experience. In doing so, setting up the foundation for modernizing the whole marketing section into a native mobile experience.</p>

				<center><figcaption>Just an example of how smartphone use dominates the market outside of North America</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Goals</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Make mobile marketing better for everyone</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">To ensure I had a purpose and "why" behind my design, I set out some goals to use as my North Star to guide my design process: 
				<ul>
					<li>Revamp Facebook carousel ad creation to a fully native mobile experience that adhered to Shopify's <a class="link2" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> design system</li>
					<li>Create an experience that is friendly to both first time and repeat users of Facebook carousel ads</li>
					<li>Design components that were scaleable and robust enough to be usable for future, more complex marketing campaign types</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				<center><figcaption>All Shopifolk designers are taught to follow a North Star</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Ideation</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Exploring the problem space</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">I began by auditing the issues within the Facebook carousel ads form; I found the current information architecture not scalable. The form had no central organizational system and new components were simply appended on. In turn, as marketing campaigns got more complex, forms would got longer and more unorganized.
				<br>
				<br>
			To tackle this scalability issue, I couldn't just consider the constraints of Facebook carousel ads; I had to take into account the constraints of all the campaign types in the marketing section. This new architecture would establish an organized structure to form components and group them based on the component's purpose.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">
				<img src="ia change.jpg" alt="information architecture change" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: cover'>
				<center><figcaption>New form IA that organized information in a clear structure and gave the merchant feedback on the purpose of each component</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<p> Forms could also get too unwieldy as more resources(products,tags etc.) were added to the page. This had been missed because on desktop there is a massive amount of screen real-estate. However, mobile couldn't afford to be wasteful with screen space.
				<br>
				<br>
			Thus, I came up with a new user flow that gameified the creation experience. To do this, the new flow would leverage the strengths of the mobile medium, in this case, drill-downs and tap-ins. Each page gave the merchant a clear purpose/goal and this new flow would cut down on the length of the main form page.</p>

			<figure class="caseImages">

				<center><figcaption>My proposal for a more goal-driven and organized user flow</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<p>Now with a new organized and goal-driven flow established, I came up with some initial mockups of the process a merchant might go through in a resource picker component. To maintain the consistency of experience throughout the app, I did a deep dive into <a class="link2" href="https://polaris.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Polaris</a> and other parts of the app to translate the previous web-designed components into native mobile designs. Furthermore, I researched both Google's <a class="link2" href="https://material.io/design/" target="_blank">Material Design</a> and Apple's <a class="link2" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/" target="_blank">Human Interface Guidelines</a> to make sure I was following each system's native app guidelines.</p>

				<center><figcaption>An initial mockup for the process of going through the product picker component</figcaption></center>
			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Iteration</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Gathering feedback and iterating upon ideas</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">I quickly discovered the trap that many designers fall into of never actualy stress-testing your designs in a real world scenario. Furthermore, I've always valued the importance of getting feedback early. So after doing some rapid-prototyping, I got my design in the hands of other designers to get their critiques and some valuable feedback:
				<ul>
					<li>Though it was a more organized and scalable flow, with so many drill down menus, the form became too slow to go through</li>
					<li>Since pages were 4 levels deep sometimes, it was difficult for merchants to keep track of their progress(ie. how many products they added to their campaign)</li>
					<li>With all the prompts and screens, it was a great experience for first-time merchants, but power-users wouldn't be able to quickly create campaigns</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> A lot of the feedback centered around the proposed new flow, people liked the scalability of it, but the time it took for a merchant to get through the process also needed to be shortened. The testing and critique sessions were an invaluable lesson in learning about trade-offs and designing for as many types of users as possible.</p>

			</figure>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Prototype</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Creating an interactive product</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 18px">After some final feedback and refinement, I came up with this final design and mocked it up in Origami Studio.
			</p>

			<h3 style="margin-top: 60px">Outcome</h3>
			<h2 style="margin-top: 18px">Reflecting on an amazing experience</h2>
			<p style="margin-top: 20px">The mobile native marketing section redesign is now in the build phase. Furthermore, since no team within Shopify had touched the mobile design system in a while, I even got to submit the redesign to the design system committee. And so, I was also able to introduce some new patterns within native mobile Polaris. Being my first real product design internship, I learned so much in these 16 weeks. Some key insights I got were:
				<ul>
					<li>As cliche as it sounds, feedback truly is a gift. By seeking out those more experienced than me, I was able to constantly refine and incorporate the knowledge of more senior designers into my work.</li>
					<li>Looping in stakeholders, specifically with the dev side, is extremely important. By talking to my mobile devs early on, I gained a fundamental understanding of the technical constraints of the mobile space before I started designing. This helped me to flesh out ideas that were actually possible for the devs to implement.</li>
				</ul></p>
